print(a*b)  #* is used to multiply
print(a/b)  #/ is used to divide and return a float
print(a//b) #// is used to divide and round down to the nearest integer
print(a%b) #% is used to get the remainder of the division

#User Input in Python 
c = int(input("Enter a number: "))
d = int(input("Enter another number: "))
print(c+d)



#If/Else Decision 

temperature = 85 #this is a variable that stores the temperature

 #if the temperature is greater than 100, print "Damn Its Hot"
if temperature > 100:
    print( "Damn Its Hot")
else:   #else is used to print "Its a nice day" if the temperature is less than 100
    print("Its a nice day") 


temp = int(input("How many degrees is it?: ")) #this is a variable that stores the temperature

if temp > 100: #if the temperature is greater than 100, print "Damn Its Hot"
    print( "Damn Its Hot")
else:
    print("Its a nice day")
